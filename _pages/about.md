  - Assembled the drone by soldering and integrating hardware components such as Pixhawk 4 flight controller and Jetson Orin NX onboard computer; flashed PX4 firmware onto the flight controller, tuned PID parameters, and conducted takeoff testing.
  - Deployed the ORB-SLAM algorithm on the onboard computer and performed debugging and adaptation using the official dataset.
  - Remotely controlled the drone's flight and used the ROS2 system to interface with the depth camera. Applied the ORB_SLAM algorithm to perform sparse 3D reconstruction of the surrounding environment, and used Octomap tools and PCL algorithms to convert the point cloud into a 3D map.
